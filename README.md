# JournalGPT

Your AI journal to vent or take notes with your voice and track your days.

## TODOs

- Switch between “vent mode” and “work mode”
  - If “vent mode”, format notes in paragraphs + suggest useful things to do + generate Dalle image summary + emotion
  - If “work mode”, format notes into bullet points w/ action items or paragraphs
- “Chat with your notes” chatbot with OpenAI assistants API embedding all your notes
  - TTS where the chatbot can respond with voice
